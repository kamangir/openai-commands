# run at scale (v7)

rerun of the [review of 3,745 studies for "study type" and "screening results"](./v6.md) on [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) through the [OpenAI API](../../completion/) after [these refactors](https://github.com/kamangir/openai-commands/issues/11):

- `choices` -> `question`:

```bash
mv choices-screening-result.yaml screening-result.yaml
mv choices-study-type.yaml study-type.yaml
mv choices1.yaml question1.yaml
```

- "because" is returned for every choice in every question.
- multiple question [workflow](https://github.com/kamangir/notebooks-and-scripts/tree/main/notebooks_and_scripts/workflow) added.
